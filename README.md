# **ASTU Gate Simulation**  
### A Python Project Using CS1Graphics  

This project is a simulation of the two main gates of **Adama Science and Technology University (ASTU)**: the **Main Gate** and the **Geda Gate**. Developed as part of my **first-year, first-semester final project**, it showcases animations, interactive elements, and realistic graphics created entirely from scratch using Python and the CS1Graphics library.  

---

## **Features**  
- **Gate Simulation:**  
  Realistic depictions of ASTU's two major gates.  
- **Car Animation:**  
  Smoothly moving cars to simulate traffic at the gates.  
- **Wind Turbine Animation:**  
  Continuously rotating wind turbines for added realism.  
- **Airplane Animation:**  
  A flying airplane displaying the message:  
  `"Programmed by Ammar Sabit"`.

## **Challenges**  
This project was a significant milestone in my programming journey:  
- Required over **40 hours of development**.  
- Demanded patience and persistence, especially during late-night coding sessions.  
- Pushed me to go beyond the project requirements to create more **realistic and visually appealing graphics**.  

---

## **Key Learnings**  
- Strengthened my knowledge of **Python programming**.  
- Gained hands-on experience with **graphics programming** using CS1Graphics.  
- Learned to manage a large project, from planning to execution.

## **How to Run the Project**  
1. **Prerequisites:**  
   - Install Python (2.7 recommended).  
   - Install the CS1Graphics library:  
     ```bash
     pip install cs1graphics
     ```  
2. **Clone the Repository:**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SHX-67/astu-gate.git
   cd astu-gate
   ```  
3. **Run the Script:**  
   ```bash
   python astu_gate.py
   ```

## **Future Plans**  
This is just the beginning of my programming journey as a **Computer Science and Engineering student** at ASTU. I plan to work on more advanced and innovative projects in the near future.
